# ABAQUS_UMAT_U3Si2SW

This repository contains INP files and subroutine codes which are a modified rate theory-based swelling constitutive model for amorphous U3Si2. More details about this model can be found in the paper "A rational incorporation of hydrostatic stress into the rate theory models for fission-gas behavior in U3Si2 dispersion fuels" published in the Materials Today Communications
